# IMDB-Analysis_Code-Lou

The project includes a README file that explains the following:
A one-paragraph or longer description of what your project is about. Do not skip this.
Relevant packages that need to be installed to run the project. This can be a requirements.txt, a config.py file, or just commands formatted neatly in markdown on your readme that say “pip install pandas” for example. But you have to specify which packages need to be installed. 
Which 5+ features you have included from the below lists to meet the requirements
Any special instructions are required for the reviewer to run your project. (For example: “run python main.py” from the command line)
Guide to using markdown for README.md files (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
Describe the data used in the analysis in the README file.


Feature 1: Read in data from a local csv, excel file, json, or any other file type. There are many ways to do this, but using Pandas read_ functions is pretty easy:

What I Did: I pulled tsv.gz data from IMDB's dataset and read into VS Code using pd.read. 

Feature 2: Use custom functions or lambdas to perform specific operations to clean or manipulate your data, return those values, then use them in other parts of your project.

What I Did: 

Feature 3: Do 5 basic calculations with Pandas, like finding the sum(), median(), mean(), or mode() of a column. You could divide two columns by each other. You could multiple a column by a random integer. You could use string operations and find the most common letter in a given entry. 

What I Did: 

Feature 4: Make 2 basic plots with matplotlib, seaborn, or any other kind of visualization library that you think looks interesting.

What I Did: Created scatterplot of all AverageRatings and NumVotes data points. 

Feature 5: If using some format other than a notebook, make sure your README explains your project. 

What I Did: This README is my vague attempt at explaining my project/thought process. I have no idea what I'm doing and I'm making it up as I go, but that pretty much explains my entire journey through adulthood, so why not.
